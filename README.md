# MPDK - Moodle Plugin Develpment Kit

This script is a simple wrapper for [Moodle Docker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker) and it's main pourpose is to make it faster and easier to use that enviroment.

It's all written in pure bash, so it should work on different system, almost without external dependencies.

It also comes with some utilities like [Moosh](https://moosh-online.com/), [Local Pluginskel](https://github.com/mudrd8mz/moodle-tool_pluginskel) with a cli interactive "Create new plugin" interface, [Local Codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) ([PhpCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)), pre-configured Node and Grunt, [Local Moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) for [PhpDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) checking.
All the tool are installed inside the container or keeped as a local copy inside the MPDK enviriment, so nothing will interfere with your actual setup.

>**INFO**
>This script is not aimed to help Moodle Core developer, as for that, tools already exist.<br>
>The script should help those developer, organization, university and instiution that develop and mantain their own plugins for the Moodle ecosystem.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed: `docker, wget, dialog, sed`<br>

**Mac**<br>
To get docker click [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)<br>
Everything else should be already installed, if not install [brew]() and then run `brew install wget dialog gnu-sed`
>**Note**: Enable "Virtualization framework" and "VitioFS filesystem" in Docker to boost performance on Mac with ARM system.


**Linux**<br>
To get docker click [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)<br>
Run `apt install dialog` or `apt install dialog wget sed` if needed (it shouldn't on most distro)


## Install


`git clone https://github.com/mattiabonzi/mpdk "~/Moodle plugin" && cd ~/Moodle\ plugin &&   chmod +x mdev && ./mdev install`

>**Note**: This will create a directory named "Moodle plugin" inside your $HOME that will be your's MPDK root, fell free to change it.


## Quick start
#### Create a new instance
To create a new inctance (a new Moodle platform for developing or testing), named "my-instance" run:

`mpdk new my-instance`

this will install the latest stable version of moodle, you can also select a specific version using the `-v` options:

`mpdk new -v3.11.5 my-instance`

> Use a meaningful name for the instance (_eg. "myplugin\_dev\_4.1.0" or "myplugin\_fix\_3.8"_) for an easier management later on


#### Run an instance
To run an instance (once created), cd into it and run:

* `mpdk run` for a develpmence instance
* `mpdk run -t` for a PhpUnit testing instance
* `mpdk run -b` for a Behat testing instance
* `mpdk run -dtb` for a develpmence, PhpUnit and Behat instace

If the instace was already initialized it will not be re-initialized, you will have to use `mpdk init` for that.

#### Stop an instance

To stop an insatnce you can use either 

* `mpdk stop` for stopping it, preserving the generated docker volumes (the generated data)
* `mpdk down` for stopping it deleting all the data (not the code)


#### Create a new plugin
For create a new plugin, ensure that you have a running instance (`mpdk ps -a` to show running instance), run the following and answer the questions.

`mpdk newplugin`

This will generate the plugin skeleton using [Local Pluginskel](), init the GIT repository and configure Grunt (yuo can select what to do during the config process).<br>
You can now start coding!

#### Run PhpUnit/Behat test
For run test case in the instance (the instance must have been initialized with the `-t` and/or `-b` options) simply run:

* `mpdk test path/to/phpunit/test`
* `mpdk test -b behat-test-tag`

OR, to run all defined test:

* `mpdk test`
* `mpdk test -b`

#### Install

`install`

Install the dev enviriment
Download all the dependencies, create the config file and ask the user if to create a symlink to "/usr/local/bin" for use "mpdk" from everywhere


#### Drop
`drop`

Delete everything (the source also) from the enviroment, use only if you want to get rid of everything


#### New
`new [-t] [-v <version>] <name>`

Create a new instance downloading the specified version of Moodle (or the latest  stable if not specified).<br>
The instance will be cerated inside the MPDK_ROOT direcotry.<br>
The name of the instance will be used for:

* name the directory
* value of the $DOCKER\_COMPOSE\_PROJECT env
* site name and site description (with '_' converted to spaces)

If the instance is created without the option "-t" some plugin are added to the standard Moodle codebase:

* tool_pluginskel: for new plugin generation
* local_codechecker: for code checking with PhpCs
* local_moodlecheck: for PhpDoc checking

The instance isn't automatically initialized.
