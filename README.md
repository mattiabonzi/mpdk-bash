# MPDK - Moodle Plugin Develpment Kit

This script is a simple wrapper for [Moodle Docker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker) and it's main pourpose is to make it faster and easier to use that repo.

It also come with some utilities like [Moosh](), [Local Pluginskel]() with a cli interactive "Create new plugin" interface, [Local Codechecker]() [(PhpCS)](), pre-configured Node and Grunt and [Local Moodlecheck]() for PhpDoc checking.
All the tool are installed inside the container or keeped as local coopy inside the MPDK enviriment, so nothing will interfere with your actual setup.

>**INFO**
>This is not aimed to help Moodle Core developer, as for that tools already exist.<br>
>The script should help those developer, organization, university and instiution that develop and mantain their own plugin for the Moodle ecosystem.

## Install

Run:

`git clone https://github.com/mattiabonzi/mpdk "Plugin dev" && cd Plugin\ dev &&   chmod +x mdev && ./mdev install`

*This will create a directory named "Plugin dev" that will be your's MPDK home, fell free to change it.*


## Quick start
#### Create a new instance
To create a new inctance (a new Moodle platform for developing or testing), named "my-instance" run:

`mpdk new my-instance`

this will install the latest stable version of moodle, you can also select a specific version using the `-v` options:

`mpdk new -v3.11.5 my-instance`

> Use a meaningful name for the instance (_eg. "myplugin\_dev\_4.1.0" or "myplugin\_fix\_3.8"_) for an easier management later on


#### Run an instance
To run an instance (once created), cd into it and run:

* `mpdk run` for a develpmence instance
* `mpdk run -t` for a PhpUnit testing instance
* `mpdk run -b` for a Behat testing instance
* `mpdk run -dtb` for a develpmence, PhpUnit and Behat instace

If the instace was already initialized it will not be re-initialized, you will have to use `mpdk init` for that.

#### Stop an instance

To stop an insatnce you can use either 

* `mpdk stop` for stopping it, preserving the generated docker volumes (the generated data)
* `mpdk down` for stopping it deleting all the data (not the code)


#### Create a new plugin
For create a new plugin, ensure that you have a running instance (`mpdk ps -a` to show running instance), run the following and answer the questions.

`mpdk newplugin`

This will generate the plugin skeleton using [Local Pluginskel](), init the GIT repository and configure Grunt (yuo can select what to do during the config process).<br>
You can now start coding!

#### Run PhpUnit/Behat test
For run test case in the instance (the instance must have been initialized with the `-t` and/or `-b` options) simply run:

* `mpdk test path/to/phpunit/test`
* `mpdk test -b behat-test-tag`

OR, to run all defined test:

* `mpdk test`
* `mpdk test -b`

    - Global options, using -i or -n
    - Setting the '\$IROOT' env to the desired instance root

Global options:

    -i <path>       Path to moodle instance (alternative to -n)
    -n <name>       Name of Moodle instance (alternative to -i)
    -h              Display help screen
    -H              Display extended help screen

Commands:

    new [-d] [-v <version>] <name>
        Create a new instance
        -d          Create a development instance
        -v          Moodle version (x.x.x or x.x)
        <name>      Name of the instance

    run [-tb] [-p <port>] [-P <port>]
        Run the instance
        -t          Run a PhpUnit test instance
        -b          Run a Behat test instance
        -p <port>   Specify the web port
        -P <port>   Specify the db port

    stop
        Stop the instance, but retain the data 

    down [-f]
        Stop the instance, and discard the data
        -f          Force, don't ask for confirmation

    test [<path>]
        Execute all or the specified PhpUnit test
        <path>      Path to the test

    sh <args..>
        Just a shortcut for 'docker exec {container-name} bash -l -c <args>'

    newplugin
        Interactive procedure to creare a tool_pluginskel reciper for generating a new plugin    
        Refers to tool_pluginskel documentation for help
    
    sniff [-pe] [<plguinames...>]
        Execute PhpCS and/or Grunt ESlint for the specified plugins
        -p          Execute only PhpCs (Incompatible with -g)
        -e          Execute only PhpCs (Incompatible with -p)
